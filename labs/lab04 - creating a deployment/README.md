# Lab 04 - Creating a Deployment in Kubernetes

Walk through the tutorial defined at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/. Execute the tutorial up until the `Proportional scaling` section. You can review the remaining text in the article but you do not need to execute as part of this lab.

Utilize either a local instance of k8s using Docker-Desktop with Kubernetes enabled (or another comparable option) or a remote instance to which you have permission to execute resource creation against.
